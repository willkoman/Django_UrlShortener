# Django Url Shortener

http://willkoman.pythonanywhere.com/

Just a basic django webapp to create shortened/obfuscated URLs, with per-user lists, and QR codes for ease of sharing

This is an ongoing project, and as such, means I will eventually migrate to a short url name so that... it actually shortens most top-level links
